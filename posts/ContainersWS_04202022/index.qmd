I recently hosted a workshop on **Using Containers for HPC** at UCLA.

The workshop took place via Zoom on April 20, 2022.

You can find the PDF and Zoom recording in the UCLA ORAC GitHub repository:

During the workshop, I covered using Singularity/Apptainer and Docker containers to run on HPC resources, such as UCLA's Hoffman2 resource. Additionally, I provided examples for using GPUs and MPI applications with containers.

Stay tuned for a follow-up workshop this summer focusing on building containers for HPC.

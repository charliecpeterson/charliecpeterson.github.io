I hosted a workshop on using Containers for HPC.

This Workshop took place via Zoom on April 20, 2022. 

The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA's ORAC github site

I went over using Singularity/Apptainer and Docker containers to run on HPC resources, like UCLA's Hoffman2 resource.

I also had some examples with using GPUs and MPI applications.

I will have a followup workshop in the Summer on making Containers.

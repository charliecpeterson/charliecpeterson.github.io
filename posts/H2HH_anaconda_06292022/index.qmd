At UCLA, we have a series of workshops named Hoffman2 Happy Hour (H2HH). These workshops are small, interactive talks based on a certain topic relating to HPC.

This Workshop took place via Zoom on June 29, 2022. 

The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA's IDRE github site

This H2HH went over using Anaconda on HPC. This was a small talk that had tips and tricks using anaconda on Hoffman2.

Stay tuned for more workshops from the Hoffman2 Team!

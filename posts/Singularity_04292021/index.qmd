In this post, I am sharing the link to a workshop I conducted on using Singularity on Hoffman2, UCLA's High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This workshop marked my first teaching experience at UCLA!

The workshop was conducted via Zoom on April 29, 2021.

You can find the repository containing the workshop materials, including the PDF presentation and Zoom recording, on UCLA's OARC GitHub site:

During the workshop, I provided a basic lecture on how to use Singularity for managing containers on Hoffman2. The GitHub repository also contains example containers that demonstrate how to work with Python and various packages, such as TensorFlow and PySCF. Additionally, there are examples of using GPU containers.

Keep an eye out for more updates on using Singularity on Hoffman2!

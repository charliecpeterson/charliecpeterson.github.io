At UCLA, we have a series of workshops named Hoffman2 Happy Hour (H2HH). These workshops are small, interactive talks based on a certain topic relating to HPC.

This Workshop took place via Zoom on March 30, 2022. 

The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA's IDRE github site

This was based on using Rstudio on UCLA's Hoffman2 resource. I had setup a Container with Rstudio Server that can be used on Hoffman2.

Stay tuned for more workshops from the Hoffman2 Team!

I hosted a workshop on Building Containers for HPC.

This Workshop took place via Zoom on July 6, 2022. 

The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA's ORAC github site

This workshop is a follow-up to a previous workshop on “Using Containers on HPC Resources”. This workshop will focus on creating containers to be ran on HPC resources. We will go over building containers using Docker/podman and Apptainer/Singularity. We will also use Hoffman2 to run our newly built containers. To follow along, users will need to install Docker or podman as well as Apptainer or Singularity on a computer they have root/admin access (Or you can just listen a watch). A GitHub or DockerHub account would also be needed to store our containers. We will provide a VM image for VituralBox with the software install. Any questions can be directed to cpeterson@oarc.ucla.edu.

After working on this book for a couple of years, a new ACS (American Chemical Society) book in the ACS symposium Series was published based on the ACS session that [Deborah Penchoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborahpenchoff/), [Theresa Windus](https://www.chem.iastate.edu/people/theresa-windus), and myself organized. 

This book have many great chapters that discuses current advances and challenges in nuclear and radiochemistry, that focus on computational approaches.

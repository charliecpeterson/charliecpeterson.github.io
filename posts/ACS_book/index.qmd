I'm excited to announce that after a couple of years of hard work, a new ACS (American Chemical Society) book in the ACS Symposium Series has been published. This book is based on the ACS session that [Deborah Penchoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborahpenchoff/), [Theresa Windus](https://www.chem.iastate.edu/people/theresa-windus), and I organized.

The book features numerous insightful chapters that discuss current advances and challenges in nuclear and radiochemistry, with a focus on computational approaches.

You can view the book at [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/book/10.1021/bk-2021-1388](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/book/10.1021/bk-2021-1388).

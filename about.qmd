# Welcome!

I'm Charles (Charlie) Peterson. With over a decade of experience in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and a solid foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm a Senior HPC System Administrator at UCLA and a passionate researcher in computational chemistry.

## Professional Journey

My journey in HPC has been marked by collaboration with scientists across various disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and material science. I've dedicated my career to optimizing the interface between hardware and software, enhancing the performance and capability of scientific applications. This has involved not only managing and improving complex computing systems but also innovating and implementing solutions that advance the boundaries of research.

## Independent Research

Parallel to my administrative role, I engage deeply in computational chemistry. My research is focused on developing advanced methods to accurately predict chemical properties of f-element containing compounds, vital for nuclear forensics and separation chemistry. My expertise in AI/ML has been instrumental in this quest, helping to drive innovation and expand the capabilities of computational research in these critical areas.

## Collaboration and Impact

Throughout my career, I've seen firsthand the transformative impact of HPC on research. My dual focus on practical system administration and theoretical innovation allows me to uniquely contribute to the ongoing evolution of scientific computing. I am committed to fostering a collaborative environment, bridging gaps between disciplines, and helping teams leverage the power of HPC for groundbreaking discoveries.

## Connect with Me

Let's make a connection that matters. Whether you're interested in HPC, AI/ML, computational chemistry, or simply want to discuss the future of technology and research, I'm here for it.

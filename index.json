The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA’s IDRE gitlab site https://gitlab.idre.ucla.edu/workshops/singularity_ws The is workshop is a basic lecture on using singularity to using containers on Hoffman2. There are example containers in the gitlab repo, showing sample containers of with python and packages like TensorFlow and PySCF. Also a example using GPU containers. Stay tuned for more updates on Singularity on Hoffman2!

I mostly wrote this code as a test to program Hartree Fock. I am thinking of adding more functions. The code is located on my GitHub page https://github.com/charliecpeterson/QUILL This program uses PySCF and libcint to generate the 1e/2e integrals. It also uses the Eigen3 API for all Matrix/linear algbra routines. The input is very similar to NWChem.

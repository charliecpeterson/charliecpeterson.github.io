# Discovering the Future with Advance Computing, Chemistry, and AI!

Welcome! I'm Charles "Charlie" Peterson, a visionary at the crossroads of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) at UCLA. As a Senior HPC System Administrator and an avid researcher in computational chemistry, I'm pioneering the use of AI/ML to revolutionize scientific exploration and discovery.


## Fusing HPC, AI, and Computational Chemistry

My journey at UCLA involves not just optimizing HPC infrastructures for unparalleled computational power but also integrating AI and ML methodologies to advance research capabilities. My research focuses on leveraging AI to untangle complex problems in nuclear forensics and separation chemistry, aiming to bring transformative solutions to longstanding challenges.

### AI-Driven Research and Innovation

By incorporating AI and ML algorithms into computational chemistry, I explore new horizons in predictive analytics, molecular modeling, and data-driven insights. This synergy allows for more accurate simulations, faster problem-solving, and groundbreaking discoveries that were previously beyond reach.

## Engage in Transformative Collaborations

If you're passionate about the potential of AI and ML to redefine the landscape of scientific research or are curious about the power of HPC to support such advancements, I welcome the opportunity to connect. Whether it's to discuss potential collaborations, exchange knowledge, or explore new ideas, you can reach me at [charles.c.peterson3@gmail.com](mailto:charles.c.peterson3@gmail.com).

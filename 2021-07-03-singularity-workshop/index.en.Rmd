Workshop using Singularity on UCLA's Hoffman2 HPC cluster

<!--more-->


This post is showing the link to a workshop I did using Singularity on Hoffman2 (UCLA's HPC cluster).

This Workshop took place via Zoom on April 29, 2021. 

The repo containing the pdf and zoom recording is located on UCLA's IDRE gitlab site

https://gitlab.idre.ucla.edu/workshops/singularity_ws

The is workshop is a basic lecture on using singularity to using containers on Hoffman2.

There are example containers in the gitlab repo, showing sample containers of with python and packages like TensorFlow and PySCF. Also a example using GPU containers.

Stay tuned for more updates on Singularity on Hoffman2!

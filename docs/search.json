This workshop will focus on creating containers to be ran on HPC resources. We will go over building containers using Docker/podman and Apptainer/Singularity. We will also use Hoffman2 to run our newly built containers. To follow along, users will need to install Docker or podman as well as Apptainer or Singularity on a computer they have root/admin access (Or you can just listen a watch). A GitHub or DockerHub account would also be needed to store our containers. We will provide a VM image for VituralBox with the software install.

    "text": "Direct determination of optimal real-space orbitals for correlated electronic structure of molecules\nAbstract:\nWe demonstrate how to determine nearly numerically exact orthonormal orbitals that are optimal for evaluation of the energy of arbitrary (correlated) states of atoms and molecules by minimization of the energy Lagrangian. Orbitals are expressed in real space using multiresolution spectral element basis that is refined adaptively to achieve the user-specified target precision while avoiding the ill-conditioning issues that plague AO basis set expansions traditionally used for correlated models of molecular electronic structure. For light atoms the orbital solver in conjunction with a variational electronic structure model [selected Configuration Interaction (CI)] provides energies of comparable precision to a state-of-the-art atomic CI solver. The computed electronic energies of atoms and molecules are significantly more accurate than the counterparts obtained with the Gaussian AO bases of the same rank, and can be determined even when linear dependence issues preclude the use of the AO bases."

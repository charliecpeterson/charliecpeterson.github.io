    "text": "I’m Charles (Charlie) Peterson. With over a decade of experience in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and a solid foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I’m a Senior HPC System Administrator at UCLA and a passionate researcher in computational chemistry.\n\n\nMy journey in HPC has been marked by collaboration with scientists across various disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and material science. I’ve dedicated my career to optimizing the interface between hardware and software, enhancing the performance and capability of scientific applications. This has involved not only managing and improving complex computing systems but also innovating and implementing solutions that advance the boundaries of research.\n\n\n\nParallel to my administrative role, I engage deeply in computational chemistry. My research is focused on developing advanced methods to accurately predict chemical properties of f-element containing compounds, vital for nuclear forensics and separation chemistry. My expertise in AI/ML has been instrumental in this quest, helping to drive innovation and expand the capabilities of computational research in these critical areas.\n\n\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative impact of HPC on research. My dual focus on practical system administration and theoretical innovation allows me to uniquely contribute to the ongoing evolution of scientific computing. I am committed to fostering a collaborative environment, bridging gaps between disciplines, and helping teams leverage the power of HPC for groundbreaking discoveries.\n\n\n\nLet’s make a connection that matters. Whether you’re interested in HPC, AI/ML, computational chemistry, or simply want to discuss the future of technology and research, I’m here for it.\nFind me on Email, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github."

As a Senior HPC System Administrator and an avid researcher in computational chemistry, I’m pioneering the use of AI/ML to revolutionize scientific exploration and discovery.\n\n\nMy journey at UCLA involves not just optimizing HPC infrastructures for unparalleled computational power but also integrating AI and ML methodologies to advance research capabilities. My research focuses on leveraging AI to untangle complex problems in nuclear forensics and separation chemistry, aiming to bring transformative solutions to longstanding challenges.\n\n\nBy incorporating AI and ML algorithms into computational chemistry, I explore new horizons in predictive analytics, molecular modeling, and data-driven insights. This synergy allows for more accurate simulations, faster problem-solving, and groundbreaking discoveries that were previously beyond reach.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re passionate about the potential of AI and ML to redefine the landscape of scientific research or are curious about the power of HPC to support such advancements, I welcome the opportunity to connect. Whether it’s to discuss potential collaborations, exchange knowledge, or explore new ideas, you can reach me at charles.c.peterson3@gmail.com.\nLet’s embark on a journey to unlock the full potential of AI and ML in science together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchemistry\n\n\nAI\n\n\nACS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nAug 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPC\n\n\nAI\n\n\nCNF\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJul 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\ncontainers\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\npaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nOct 19, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\nAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nOct 19, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\nAI\n\n\nMeeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nAug 13, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nMeeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nApr 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\ncontainers\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nApr 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nContainers\n\n\nWorkshops\n\n\nHPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nApr 5, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nRStudio\n\n\nWorkshops\n\n\nH2HH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nMar 29, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\npaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nDec 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nBig Data\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nOct 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchemistry\n\n\npublication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJul 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\ncontainers\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJul 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nanaconda\n\n\npython\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\nH2HH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJun 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\ncontainers\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nApr 20, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nrstudio\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\nH2HH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nMar 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACS\n\n\npublication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nDec 31, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\ncontainers\n\n\nworkshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJul 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nchemistry\n\n\npython\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peterson\n\n\nJun 30, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

This workshop will focus on creating containers to be ran on HPC resources. We will go over building containers using Docker/podman and Apptainer/Singularity. We will also use Hoffman2 to run our newly built containers. To follow along, users will need to install Docker or podman as well as Apptainer or Singularity on a computer they have root/admin access (Or you can just listen a watch). A GitHub or DockerHub account would also be needed to store our containers. We will provide a VM image for VituralBox with the software install. Any questions can be directed to cpeterson@oarc.ucla.edu."

    "text": "Direct determination of optimal real-space orbitals for correlated electronic structure of molecules\nAbstract:\nWe demonstrate how to determine nearly numerically exact orthonormal orbitals that are optimal for evaluation of the energy of arbitrary (correlated) states of atoms and molecules by minimization of the energy Lagrangian. Orbitals are expressed in real space using multiresolution spectral element basis that is refined adaptively to achieve the user-specified target precision while avoiding the ill-conditioning issues that plague AO basis set expansions traditionally used for correlated models of molecular electronic structure. For light atoms the orbital solver in conjunction with a variational electronic structure model [selected Configuration Interaction (CI)] provides energies of comparable precision to a state-of-the-art atomic CI solver. The computed electronic energies of atoms and molecules are significantly more accurate than the counterparts obtained with the Gaussian AO bases of the same rank, and can be determined even when linear dependence issues preclude the use of the AO bases."

Theoretical investigations employing molecular modeling methods, such as ab initio and Density Functional Theory (DFT), have been instrumental in simulating binding interactions, with computational protocols being refined for superior accuracy encompassing relativity, spin-orbit coupling, and core correlation effects. The integration of contemporary data modeling approaches, like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), further augments our understanding of binding selectivity properties. A notable stride in this domain is the advent of the REACKT program, which endeavors to bolster the precision and efficiency of computational methodologies. This presentation delineates the development and integration of computational protocols within the REACKT framework, illustrating how this program propels the frontier of lanthanide and actinide chemistry modeling. By leveraging the REACKT program, we elucidate how a synergistic blend of traditional computational chemistry methods and modern data analytics can significantly enhance predictive accuracy and provide deeper insights into the complex behavior of lanthanide and actinide systems."

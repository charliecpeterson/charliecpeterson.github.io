The orbitals are expressed in real space using a multiresolution spectral element basis that is adaptively refined to achieve the user-specified target precision while avoiding the ill-conditioning issues typically associated with AO basis set expansions in traditional correlated models of molecular electronic structure.\nOur orbital solver, combined with a variational electronic structure model (selected Configuration Interaction or CI), provides energies of comparable precision to a state-of-the-art atomic CI solver for light atoms. The calculated electronic energies of atoms and molecules are significantly more accurate than those obtained with Gaussian AO bases of the same rank. Furthermore, our method can determine these energies even when linear dependence issues preclude the use of AO bases."

Theoretical investigations employing molecular modeling methods, such as ab initio and Density Functional Theory (DFT), have been instrumental in simulating binding interactions, with computational protocols being refined for superior accuracy encompassing relativity, spin-orbit coupling, and core correlation effects. The integration of contemporary data modeling approaches, like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), further augments our understanding of binding selectivity properties. A notable stride in this domain is the advent of the REACKT program, which endeavors to bolster the precision and efficiency of computational methodologies. This presentation delineates the development and integration of computational protocols within the REACKT framework, illustrating how this program propels the frontier of lanthanide and actinide chemistry modeling. By leveraging the REACKT program, we elucidate how a synergistic blend of traditional computational chemistry methods and modern data analytics can significantly enhance predictive accuracy and provide deeper insights into the complex behavior of lanthanide and actinide systems."
